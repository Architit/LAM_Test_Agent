2026-02-16 07:56 UTC — governance: workflow optimization protocol sync (`workflow-optimization-protocol-sync-v2`) — enforced `M46`, manual intervention fallback, and `ONE_BLOCK_PER_OPERATOR_TURN` across repository protocol surfaces.
2026-02-17 00:43 UTC — WB-01 deep repository analysis completed — architecture/failure/risk map built; multi-wave strategy documented (`WB01_LAM_TEST_AGENT_DEEP_ANALYSIS_AND_STRATEGY_2026-02-17.md`) and roadmap phased for stabilization, quality, evolution, expansion.
2026-02-17 00:51 UTC — WB-01 Phase A stabilization implemented — added submodule bootstrap script, centralized path bootstrap helper, pytest preflight/marker skip for missing submodules; test gate changed from collection error to `1 passed, 1 skipped`.
2026-02-17 00:56 UTC — WB-01 Phase B quality engineering completed — placeholder smoke replaced by contract-oriented smoke, marker taxonomy introduced (`unit/integration/submodule_required`), split test entrypoints added; current baseline: unit `8 passed`, integration `1 skipped`, full `8 passed, 1 skipped`.
2026-02-17 01:00 UTC — WB-01 Wave C expansion executed — contract module added (`lam_test_agent_contracts.py`), payload/trace/envelope test suites introduced, ping-pong integration aligned with contract normalization; coverage scaled to `49 collected / 48 passed / 1 skipped`.
2026-02-17 01:00 UTC — mirror gap strategy published (`TEST_GAP_MIRROR_STRATEGY_2026-02-17.md`) — staged search pipeline defined for missing ecosystem tests (interface/behavior/operational/governance mirrors).

2026-02-17 21:16 UTC — WB-02 ecosystem protocol expansion initiated — published strategy (`memory/FRONT/ECOSYSTEM_PROTOCOL_EXPANSION_STRATEGY_2026-02-17.md`), introduced machine-readable safety/resource stack (`memory/FRONT/ECOSYSTEM_SAFETY_RESOURCE_STACK_V1.json`), added stack validator (`lam_test_agent_safety_stack.py`) and CI quality gate integration.
2026-02-17 21:25 UTC — WB-02 telemetry baseline collected across ecosystem repos — added collector (`lam_test_agent_ecosystem_telemetry.py`), generated `memory/FRONT/ECOSYSTEM_TELEMETRY_SNAPSHOT_2026-02-17.{json,md}`; summary: `repo_count=16`, `dirty_repos=16`, `repos_with_tests=15`, `repos_with_ci=3`, `repos_with_governance_triad=15`, `repos_with_submodules=2`.
2026-02-17 21:31 UTC — WB-02 live activation policy checks implemented — added policy evaluator (`lam_test_agent_live_policy.py`) linked to `network_resolution_gate` + `submodule_readiness_gate` + budget gates; integrated non-enforcing policy report generation in CI quality and emitted `memory/FRONT/LIVE_ACTIVATION_POLICY_REPORT_2026-02-17.{json,md}`.
2026-02-17 21:36 UTC — WB-02 phase E drift reporting implemented — added stack-vs-implementation drift analyzer (`lam_test_agent_phasee_drift.py`) with unblock-condition synthesis from live policy blockers; integrated non-enforcing CI generation of `memory/FRONT/PHASE_E_DRIFT_REPORT_2026-02-17.{json,md}`.
2026-02-17 21:46 UTC — WB-02 degraded-mode conformance gate integrated into live policy (`degraded_mode_conformance_gate`) — phase E drift coverage reached `100%` with `missing_layers=0`; live policy remains `BLOCKED` with `mock_only` due to external readiness blockers (network/submodules/dirty-budget/P0-budget).
2026-02-17 22:06 UTC — semantic-selection naming pattern applied for arrierguard role — published triplet proposal for `LAM_Test_Agent` (`true_name=Aryargvardshpoisat`, `call_sign=Arrierguard`, `system_id=ARGD`) in `memory/FRONT/SEMANTIC_SELECTION_LAM_TEST_AGENT_ARRIERGUARD_2026-02-17.md`; state set to `HOLD` pending naming-governance activation.
2026-02-17 22:18 UTC — governance: identity-map artifacts synced to canonical ARGD triplet across FRONT/AVANGARD/ARCHIVE/GUARD_HEAL (`Aryargvardshpoisat` / `Arrierguard` / `ARGD`); status normalized to ACTIVE with SoT evidence `SEMANTIC_SELECTION_ARGD_ACTIVATION_DECISION_CONTRACT.md`.
2026-02-17 22:22 UTC — growth execution: deadloop inter-repo test matrix expanded (`tests/it/test_deadloop_cross_repo.py`) with guard HOLD/PASS and ecosystem scan assertions against `LAM`; growth snapshot regenerated (`memory/FRONT/TEST_MATRIX_GROWTH_SNAPSHOT.json`) and now includes `summary.deadloop_cross_repo` + per-route `has_deadloop_cross_repo_assertions`.
2026-02-17 22:23 UTC — growth telemetry checkpoint published: `before/after` delta for deadloop inter-repo matrix expansion stored in `memory/FRONT/TEST_MATRIX_GROWTH_BEFORE_AFTER_2026-02-17.{json,md}`; delta confirms route count unchanged and observability depth increased via explicit deadloop coverage fields.
2026-02-17 22:29 UTC — policy/drift hardening: `growth_checkpoint_gate` promoted to mandatory readiness signal in `lam_test_agent_live_policy.py` and stack drift mapping (`lam_test_agent_phasee_drift.py`); safety stack extended with required layer `growth_checkpoint_gate` (order=27) and policy/drift reports regenerated (`LIVE_ACTIVATION_POLICY_REPORT_2026-02-17.*`, `PHASE_E_DRIFT_REPORT_2026-02-17.*`).
2026-02-17 22:32 UTC — CI hardening: added `growth_checkpoint_artifact_gate` validator (`lam_test_agent_growth_checkpoint_gate.py`) and enforced it in quality workflow step (`python -m lam_test_agent_growth_checkpoint_gate ...`); safety stack extended with required layer `growth_checkpoint_artifact_gate` (order=28), drift remains `100%` (`28/28`) after regeneration.
2026-02-17 22:36 UTC — CI hardening v2: `growth_checkpoint_artifact_gate` extended with snapshot-sync checks (`--snapshot`), enforcing timestamp parity (`after.observed_snapshot_generated_at_utc` vs `TEST_MATRIX_GROWTH_SNAPSHOT.generated_at_utc`) and structural parity of `deadloop_cross_repo` telemetry block; workflow step updated accordingly, unit tests expanded (`tests/unit/test_growth_checkpoint_gate.py`).
2026-02-17 22:42 UTC — CI hardening v3: introduced `telemetry_freshness_gate` (`lam_test_agent_telemetry_freshness_gate.py`) with TTL and timestamp-chain validation across `TEST_MATRIX_GROWTH_SNAPSHOT`, `TEST_MATRIX_GROWTH_BEFORE_AFTER`, `LIVE_ACTIVATION_POLICY_REPORT`, `PHASE_E_DRIFT_REPORT`; wired into quality workflow and safety stack (`telemetry_freshness_gate`, order=29). Post-refresh drift coverage remains `100%` (`29/29`), `pytest=138 passed, 1 skipped`.
2026-02-17 22:48 UTC — CI hardening v4: introduced `telemetry_integrity_gate` (`lam_test_agent_telemetry_integrity_gate.py`) with SHA256 manifest lifecycle (`mode=create` after checkpoint gate, `mode=verify` after freshness gate) to detect in-pipeline artifact mutation; safety stack extended with `telemetry_integrity_gate` (order=30), drift refreshed to `100%` (`30/30`), `pytest=142 passed, 1 skipped`.
2026-02-18 00:39 UTC — semantic topology healing: materialized physical subtree root `<WORK_ROOT>/Archivator_Agent/SubtreeHub/ARGD/Arrierguard` with 9 artifact-group branches (`protocols/contracts/policies/atlas/maps/chronologs/logs/journals/matrices`) and parity-copied list artifacts from local memory sources.
2026-02-18 00:40 UTC — critical gate validation after topology healing — telemetry/policy refreshed: `semantic_identity_governance_gate=OK`, `archivator_handoff_gate=OK`, `LIVE_ACTIVATION_POLICY_REPORT status=READY mode=live_plus_mock`; gateway verification confirms `github=ok` across listed ecosystem repos.
2026-02-18 00:47 UTC — ARGD subtree access audit published (`memory/FRONT/ARGD_SUBTREE_ACCESS_AUDIT_2026-02-18.md`) with coverage reconciliation (`gateway_ok_repos=15`, `argd_protocol_paths=15`) and residual risk note on stale `*_latest.tsv` indices pending dedicated long-running refresh window.
2026-02-18 01:06 UTC — Archivator full refresh completed in background (`global_refresh:ok`) — latest index artifacts updated; `ARGD/Arrierguard` entries now present in `ecosystem_file_matrix_latest.tsv`.
2026-02-18 01:07 UTC — phase drift artifacts refreshed to current policy state (`memory/FRONT/PHASE_E_DRIFT_REPORT.{json,md}`) — `live_policy_status=READY`, `coverage=100%`, `missing_layers=0`.
